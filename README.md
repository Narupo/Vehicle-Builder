  ## Installation
  First, clone the respository onto your local PC. This can be done by using the "Code" dropdown menu within the github repository and adding the SSH link to your clipboard. Once you have done this, open VS Code and use the terminal to navigate to the directory you would like to work in. Once in the directory, within the VS Code terminal type "git clone (paste SSH link here)" and then hit enter. Now you should have most of the necessary files to run the application within your desired directory. Once you have finished cloning the repository, run the application in an intergrated terminal. This can be done by right clicking the directory within VS code and selecting "Open in intergrated terminal". Once within your new intergrated terminal, run "npm install". This will install the rest of the necessary files and dependencies to run the program.

  ## Usage
  Once you have finished the installation process you are now ready to use the application! To start the application, within an integrated terminal, type "npm start". This will start the application and open a prompt that allows users to either create a vehicle or select an exsisting vehicle and perform actions with them. The user can navigate through the application using the up and down arrow keys and can use the enter key to submit their answers. Once the user is finished using the application they can navigate to "exit" and hit enter to close the application.
